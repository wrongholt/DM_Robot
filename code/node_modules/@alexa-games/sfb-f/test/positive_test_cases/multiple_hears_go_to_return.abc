// multiple *hears in the goto-and-return scene	
// 1. in the initial scene, create a *then goto-and-return function
// 2. in the scene that the goto points to, insert 3 different *hear statements.
// 3. run the simulator.
// 4. give all utterances.	Verify the *hears can be executed properly in the simulator, and the first scene is returned to properly.

// this goes to @multiple hears to modify a variable based off user input, then loops back to @multiple go to hears to move on within the flow.
@multiple go to hears
    *say
        Welcome to the multiple go to hears test.  We're about to go into a scene with a handful of hear statements, then return back to here!
    *then
        <-> multiple hears
        -> variable thingy

@multiple hears
    *say
        Say one of these words: Chocolate, Purple, Oranges, or, Macho Man.
    *then
        hear chocolate {
            set word to 'chocolate'
            set points to 1
            >> RETURN
        }
        hear purple {
            set word to 'purple'
            set points to 2
            >> RETURN
        }
        hear oranges {
            set word to 'oranges'
            set points to 3
            >> RETURN

            set points to 4
            >> RETURN
        }

@variable thingy
    *say
        You chose {word}, which got you {points} points!
        Try again?
    *then
        hear yes {
            -> multiple go to hears
        }
        hear no {

// TESTS TO RUN:
// Test 1: launch >> say 'go to return with variables' >> say 'chocolate' >> say 'yes' >> say 'purple' >> say 'yes' >> say 'oranges' >> say 'yes' >> say 'macho man' >> say 'no' to end.
