@repeat test
    *say
        Welcome to the Repeat test. Say "hear this again" if you want to repeat this line. Or, say "move on" to go to the next scene.
    *then
        // Verify: say statement is repeated
        hear hear this again {
            >> REPEAT
        }
        hear move on {
            -> repeat scene two
        }

@repeat scene two
    *say
        <audio src='https://s3.amazonaws.com/alexa-ml/sounds/sound-library-loud/Instruments/Trumpet_1.mp3' />
        Say "hear this again" to repeat the trumpet sound and this text. Or say "end" to end the test.
    *then
        // Verify: say statement with audio src tag is repeated without issue
        hear hear this again {
            >> REPEAT
        }
        hear move on {
            -> repeat scene three
        }

@repeat scene three
    *say
        This is a say statement. 
        Say HODOR to hear the recap. 
        Don't say anything to hear the reprompt. 
        Say END to quit.
    *recap
        Recap statement. This should play if the user says something unexpected like HODOR!
        // verifies recap can be repeated
        Say REPEAT to repeat this statement.
        Say END to quit.
        Say RETRY to retry.
    // repeats the reprompt statement when user says nothing. Automatically happens when running in the simulator.
    *reprompt
        Reprompt statement. This should play if the user says nothing when prompted to respond.
        // verifies reprompt can be repeated
        Say REPEAT to repeat this statement.
        Say END to quit.
        Say RETRY to retry.
    *then
        hear retry {
            -> repeat scene three
        }
        hear end {
            -> end
        }
        hear repeat {
            >> REPEAT
        }
