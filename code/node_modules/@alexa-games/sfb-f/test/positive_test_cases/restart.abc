// TESTS:
// 1) Basic restart functionality
//    - launch >> "restart test" >> "restart" >> verify that skill navigates back to @start scene
// 2) Variables save through restarts
//    - launch >> "restart test" >> "restart" >> "restart test" >> verify variable is at 1 now >> "restart" >> "restart test" >> verify variable is at 2 now >> "end"
