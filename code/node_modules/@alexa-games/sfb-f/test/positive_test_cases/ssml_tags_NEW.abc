// Kendra voice tags taken directly from SFB documentation. Prosody taken from SSML documentation.
// Unable to verify Kendra voice tags working in PCON

// All of this needs to be validated before we can say any of this works. It also looks like a lot of information on these tags are missing.
// Ex: Line 5, nowhere does it state to change the language to FR.
// It compiles because its all a say statement, so its treated as a string.  But does it actually DO the thing?
