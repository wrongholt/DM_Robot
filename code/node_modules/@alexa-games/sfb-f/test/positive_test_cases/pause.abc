// Similar to a real game where the player would pause in the middle of gameplay,
// and come back and resume later from a certain point, saving variables (progress).
// Clears hitPoints from any previous playthroughs, then sets it to 10.
// When you pause, the skill ends, and then when the skill resumes, it should drop you in the @resume scene with your hitPoints set to 10.
// The only true way to test this is manually on the dev console/device (or through ASK dialog).

@pause test
    *say
        Welcome to the pause and resume test.
        Say continue to drink a health potion!
    *then
		clear hitPoints
		set hitPoints to 10
        hear continue {
			-> pt pause
		}

@pt pause
	*say
		// should be 10 hit points.
		You have {hitPoints} hit points!
		Say pause to pause the game!
		Say end to end the test.
		Or say drink to drink another health potion!
	*then
		// pauses the scene, do this first
		hear pause {
			>> PAUSE
		}
		// quits the test when you are done
		hear end {
			clear hitPoints
			-> end
		}
		// increases hitpoints, allowing you to verify a variable can be changed/saved through multiple pause loops
		hear drink {
			increase hitPoints by 10
			-> pt pause
		}

@pause
	*say
		You made it to the pause scene! The skill will end, but when you relaunch it you should automatically start at the resume scene!
	*then
		>> PAUSE

@resume
    *say
        Resuming from where you left off last.
    *then
        >> RESUME


// Tests:
// 1) Pause and Resume terminators
//    - launch >> "Pause test" >> "continue" >> "pause" >> relaunch the game >> verify that @resume occurs on launch >> verify that hit points are set to 10 >> "end"

// 2) User increases variable and is saved through pause and resume
//    - launch >> "Pause test" >> "continue" >> "drink" >> "Pause" >> relaunch the game >> verify that hit points are set to 20 >> "end"

// 3) Variable is not cleared from multiple pause states
//    - launch >> "Pause test" >> "continue" >> "Pause" >> relaunch the game >> verify that hit points are set to 10 >> "pause" >> relaunch the game >> verify that hit points are set to 10 still
